### Protocol Stack Analysis for Intel Chipset Platform
#### Client Name: Intel Mobile Communication
Experience in analyzing call flow of LTE/UMTS/GSM call processing UE protocol side and possess end-toend call flow of LTE/UMTS/GSM
 Analysis on UE side protocol stack analysis like NAS, RRC, PDCP, RLC, MAC on LTE/UMTS/GSM
 Analyzing UE's functional failure scenarios at modem level like Multi RAB, SRVCC, CSFB, CA, inter/intra
band, Inter-RAT handover, IMS VoLTE calls, SIP messages, data stall, call drops, bad audio quality calls,
PDP failures, ping failures, RF antenna imbalance, Handover failures, Handover failures from protocol
stack perspective.
 Analyzing stack level failure issues like RLF, incorrect measurement reporting, NAS fail to initiate
message, decoding issues at FW, MAC scheduling and UL grants check, MAC HARQ check, RRC reestablishment causes, RRC criteria failure, RACH failure, RLC VTA/VTS/VRR issues
 Analysis of call KPI, modem crashes with respect to 4G/3G FW
 Python scripting for automating log analysis process
 Good understanding in LTE EPC elements from LTE 3GPP specifications 36.321, 36.322, 36.232 36.331,
24.301, 23.401 complying MAC,RLC, PDCP,RRC protocols
 Good understanding in 5GC elements from 3GPP specification 23.501, 23.502, 24.501, 38.321, 38.322,
38.223,38.331, 38.523
